      <h3>Arnaldo Cavallari and Ciabatta</h3>
      <p>Ciabatta was invented in 1982 by Arnaldo Cavallari, a baker who was looking for a bread to outcome the popularity of baguettes used in sandwiches.</p>
      <p>Arnaldo and many other bakers were concerned about the increase of sandwiches made from baguettes imported from France, which would endangered their businesses. After many weeks of testing different recipes with different flours and different hydration levels, he finally came out with the perfect bread to make panini.</p>
