      <h3>Ancient Egyptian and Sourdough</h3>
      <p>Sourdough is the oldest form of leavened bread and was used at least as early as ancient Egypt.</p>
      <p>It was probably discovered by accident when bread dough was left out and good microorganisms -- wild yeast -- drifted into the mix. The resulting bread had a lighter texture and better taste.</p>
