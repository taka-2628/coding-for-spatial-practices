      <p>There are a few theories as to how Bagel came into being, and because it is so controversial that someone wrote <a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300158205/bagel">a book</a> about the origin of this beloved bread.</p>
      <p>Of all the theories discussed in the book, the most popular yet fictious and incongrous story give credit to a Viennese baker for the invention.</p>
      <p>The baker invented the bagel in the late 17th century, and made it as a tribute to the King of Poland, Jan Sobieski III, who led forces to save Austria from Turkish invaders. The baker, aware of the king's love of horses, shaped the yeast dough into a circle and called it a beugel, which is Austrian for "stirrup."</p>
