      <p>Arepa originated from indigenous tribes in Colombia and Venezuela</p>
      <p>Now, it is considered a gastronomic icon of Colombia and Venezuela, and a common heritage shared by these nations.</p>
      <p>The oldest reference to the word Arepa comes from the book by European traveler Galeotto Cei "Journey and description of the Indies (1539-1553)"</p>
      <p>
        "They make another kind of bread with corn as tortillas, a finger thick, round and large as a plate to the French, or a little more or less, and put them to cook in a pan over the fire, smearing it with fat so that they do not stick, turning them until they are cooked on both sides and this class is called areppas and some fecteguas"
