      <h3>Cassava Processing by the Slaves in Brazil and Cheese Bread</h3>
      <p>Cheese bread has its roots in the culinary creations of African slaves. </p>
      <p>The slaves, having mouths to feed, would soak and peel the cassava root, which was considered inedible by the landowners, and make bread rolls from it.</p>
      <p>At the end of the 19th century, after slavery ended, other foods were made available to the Afro-Brazilian population. And in the State of Minas Gerais, the center of the dairy production in Brazil, cheese and milk were added to the balls of starch. So, with a combination of Afro-Brazilian ethnicity and the agricultural geography of Minas Gerais, cheese bread as we now all know it, came to be.</p>
