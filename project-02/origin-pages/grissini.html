      <h3>Duke Vittorio Amedeo II and Grissini</h3>
      <p>Grissini were invented around the end of the 17th century to cure the health problems of young Duke Vittorio Amedeo II of Savoy.</p>
      <p>The duke had difficulty digesting most foods and Don Baldo di Lanzo, the court doctor, commissioned a baker from Torino, Antonio Brunero, to create something that the young duke could digest.</p>
      <p>His creation was a great success and became so popular, it entered the daily life of the Torinesi â€“ and later the whole of Italy.</p>
