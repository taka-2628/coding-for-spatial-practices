      <h3>Pretzel in Hortus Deliciarum</h3>
      <p>Pretzel has its origin around 610 A.D. in the region between the south of France and northern Italy. It then became popular and spread into Austria and Germany.</p>
      <p>During the Middle Ages, monks gave away pretzels to the poor as a religious symbol that additionally provided literal sustenance. In the Cathoric Church, they were considered a sign of good luck and spiritual wholenessâ€”possibly due to the three holes in the common pretzel shape touted to represent the Holy Trinity.</p>
      <p>Due to it's religious significance, pretzels appear in many medieval artworks such as Hortus Deliciarum (1185)</p>
