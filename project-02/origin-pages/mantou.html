      <h3>Zhuge Liang and Mantou</h3>
      <p>The Mantou seems to have appeared during the Zhou Dynasty (1046 – 771 BC) in East China.</p>
      <p>A popular Chinese legend relate that the word “mantou” would mean “barbarian’s head”, as the story of Zhuge Liang, a well-known regent and military strategist, say that he needed to cross the Lu River, which had big, stormy waves. The locals told him that to appease the river, he had to sacrifice 50 barbarian’s head and throw them in the river. Zhuge Liang didn’t want to lose more of his men, so he ordered them to kill the livestock, and fill their meat into a flour dough, shaped like human heads. The buns were then thrown into the river. After a successful crossing, he decided to name the bun barbarian’s head, so mantou.</p>
