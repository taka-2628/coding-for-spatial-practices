      <h3>Taino Tribe and Casabe</h3>
      <p>Casabe was the staple food of Native American communities in pre-Columbian civilization. Its long shelf life and health benefits (cassava being rich in fiber and vitamins) have enabled them to survive harsh periods of scarcity.</p>
      <p>Originally, it was the Taino Indians, an ethnic group that was part of the Arawak group, who produced casabe.</p>
      <p>Etymologically, “casabe” comes from casabi, the arawak term which designates cassava (also called tapioca or yuca).</p>
