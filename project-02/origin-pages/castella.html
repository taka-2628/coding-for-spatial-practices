      <h3>Portuguese Missionaries and Castella</h3>
      <p>The castella was first brought to Japan by Portuguese missionaries during the 16th century when Nagasaki, which is located on the northwest coast of Kyushu island, was a Portuguese trading outpost. </p>
      <p>It was introduced to the Japanese as “Pão de Castela,” meaning “bread from Castille”. It then became known as “Castella,” or kasutera as pronounced in Japanese.</p>
      <p>The recipe was transformed in Japan: its incorporation of mizuame, a local starch syrup gives the cake its moist and lightly chewy texture.</p>
