      <h3>Refrigerator, Baking Soda, the Great Depression and Banana Bread</h3>
      <p>Banana, the most sold fruit in the U.S. today, was not available in the county until the advent of refrigeration at the turn of the 20th century which made bananas accessible to American households.</p>
      <p>In 1929, the Great Depression began. Food was scarce and every penny mattered.</p>
      <p>Around the same time, baking soda and baking powder began to be mass-produced. The desire to use overripe bananas, paired with the ready availability of baking powder, inspired a horde of enterprising cookbook writers to come up with recipes for banana bread.</p>
